Summary of Design Decisions

Angular Framework: Chosen for building single-page applications.

Reactive Forms: Used for better form handling.

Components: 
1) Nav: used for nav bar.
2) user-list: user to show all user data and applications.
3) user-upset: user to create and edit user.

Routing: Utilized Angular's routing for navigation between user-upsert and user-list components.

Service: Implemented a UserService to manage user data and communicate between components.

Styling: Applied basic styling using Bootstrap for a clean and visually appealing UI.
